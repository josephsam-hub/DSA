WE CAN USE THREE POINTS APPROACH FOR OPTIMAL APPROACH : 
            #THE ALGORITHM IS DUTCH NATIONAL FLAG ALGO
            - STEP1 : CREATE A LOW POINTER AT BEGIN OF ARRAY  AND HIGH POINTER AT END OF THE ARRAY
            - STEP 2 : CREATA A MID POINTER , THAT START AT THE BEGINING OF THE ARRAY AND ITERATE TO EACH ELEMENTS 
            - STEP 3 : IF THE ELEMENT AT ARRAY OF MID IS 2 ,THEN SWAP MID PONITER AND HIGH POINTER, DECREASE THE LOW PONITER
            - STEP 4 : AND INCREASE THE LOW AND HIGH POINTER
            - STEP 5 : IF MID IS 1 , THEN DONT SWAP AND INCREASE MID POINTER , IT WILL STOP WHEN MID POINTER  CROSS THE HIGH POINTER.
